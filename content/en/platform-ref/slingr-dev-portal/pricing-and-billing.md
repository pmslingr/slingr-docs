Pricing of the platform is based on apps. [You can check the pricing here](https://www.slingr.io/platform/pricing).

Each app will have a corresponding subscription, which can be associated with any of the four products we offer:

ðŸ‘‰ **`Slingr Personal Plan:`** These apps have a free 15-day trial period and won't incur any charges.
After this period, these apps will have a fixed monthly fee.

* You have the possibility to create up to 20 Entities.
* You can use the Shared Services.
* And you have the possibility to use a file storage up to 5 Gb.

ðŸ‘‰ **`Slingr Professional Plan:`** These apps have a fixed monthly fee.

* All the benefits of the previous plan.
* You will be able to add an extra developer to your app.
* You have the possibility to create unlimited Entities.
* The file storage grows and allows you to store up to 20 Gb in files.
* And you will have the possibility to create your own Services Dedicated to your application.

ðŸ‘‰ **`Slingr Business Plan:`** These apps also have a fixed monthly fee.

* All the benefits of the previous plan.
* You will be able to add an extra developer (one more in addition to the previous plan) to your app.
* The file storage grows and allows you to store up to 25 Gb in files for each environment (up to 50 Gb between development and production).

ðŸ‘‰ **`Slingr Enterprise Plan:`** These apps will be charged based on usage.
The more environments, instances, services, etc., you use, the more you will pay.
As advantages in this plan you have:

* All the benefits of the previous plan.
* The possibility of scaling the application up to 10 replicas to offer greater availability.
* An unlimited number of developers can be added.
* You will be able to configure your database in a dedicated way.
* File storage becomes unlimited.
* You will be able to install Premium tier Packages.

It's essential to note that although you see monthly prices on our website, we bill hourly. This means that your end-of-month payment may not be exact, but it will be similar. This benefits you because you only pay for what you use. For example, if you need to spin up an app for testing purposes, you can create one, perform the necessary tests, and then delete it, and you will be charged only for the time you used it.

Keep in mind that Slingr offers additional services like support and professional services that are not part of the platform billing scope. You can find more information about them on the [Slingr website](https://slingr.io).
